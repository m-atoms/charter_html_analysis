To help students succeed in the classroom, this framework bolsters current resources available in schools, and may include academic support, social/emotional interventions, strategies to address persistent poverty and trauma, or support for families to secure stability. Many of these needs can be met within the school by District educators and support staff including but not limited to school nurses, in-classroom tutors, literacy and math specialists, academic coaches, social workers, specialized curriculum, and school psychologists. Other interventions can be achieved with the assistance of community-based organizations and/or City departments including but not limited to programs and assistance to alleviate the impacts of poverty and/or trauma, after-school programming, therapeutic arts and culture programing, and summer school.\n",

The community schools framework continuously monitors programs and practices in each school community to ensure that strategies support student progress and outcomes, and that the entire school community is part of that work. The Fund is also born of a belief that it takes a village to successfully educate students, and the involvement of more caring adults to help students overcome challenges is a building block to their ultimate success.\n",
